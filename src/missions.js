1. disply the json project as regula js file

1. give for any object a name or id - ? npm package / loopFunc map with key / {key=someKey}

2. acsses any object by his name or id - by fet method?

3. save (by .push? .append?) any object with his name or id on the server (4000 of express or firebase)

4. see all resume that posted ever on the nodejs terminal
5. see all resume that posted ever on the console.log of chrome
6. display all resume that posted ever on the client side 3000/ somePath
7. display all resume that posted ever on the server side 4000/somePath


**acsses in deferent route to the posted resume
** maybe save all resume that posted on local 4000 / firebase / etc
** acsess all resumes in other route

1. save all objects on the server after posting data - see it on 4000
2. display on 4000 all objects data not as json

2. acsses the data we saved after posting

2. re-render the page to /styledResume route with the final result

3. css - style all routes
